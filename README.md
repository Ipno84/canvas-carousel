# canvas-carousel

Canvas Carousel is a module written with the objective of completing the task for selection at Publitas.com.

## What is this?!

It is nothing more and nothing less than a basic touch image carouseli written entirely in typescript and framework agnostic, allowing a carousel of images to be generated within a canvas element.<br />
The carousel responds both to dragging by single finger touch, whether the device responds to touch on the screen, and to dragging by mouse pressure and movement.<br />
Furthermore, depending on the options set during initialisation, it can be fluid responsive.

## Can I see it in action?

To be able to see it in action, at present, it is necessary to clone the repository and run the package in development mode (I may publish it in the future, but to do so, I would like the development to be more solid and tested without considering that the module deserves to have further functionality developed (snap scroll, momentum, etc.)

---

### 1. Install global dependencies

During development, yarn package manager was used. It is also possible to use npm or pnpm, but when installing modules, it will not be possible to refer to the lock file, so compatibility cannot be guaranteed in this case.

If you have not yet installed yarn on your device, you can do so by following the instructions at [this link](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/installhttps:/)

You also need node installed on your device. If you have not yet installed it, you can do so at [this link](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### 2. Clone repositories

Once your environment is ready with all the necessary global dependencies, you can clone the repository. To do so, you can either use your favourite GUI (I recommend SourceTree or GitKraken in addition to Github Desktop) or run the following command from your terminal after navigating to the folder in which you intend to clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/Ipno84/canvas-carousel.git
```

### 3. Install local dependencies

The project has no direct dependencies except those necessary for development (typescript, webpack, jest and typing).<br/>
Navigate to the project folder and run the command to install the yarn dependencies as shown below

```
yarn install
```

### 4. Run project in dev mode

You should now be able to launch the project in development mode using the node server generated by webpack-dev-server running the command as shown below.<br/>

```
yarn start
```

The module should automatically open to the http://localhost:8080 page displaying a canvas inside which 4 images and a set of cta will be loaded immediately below it

## What can I do with it?

You can drag the mouse cursor within the canvas to move its contents to the right or left. Once you have reached the limits of the 4 images, the canvas carousel should not allow any further movement and will not produce any results.<br/>
If no changes have been made to the ./src/start.ts file, the canvas will be responsive and will adapt its dimensions to the internal dimensions of the container in which it is inscribed.<br/>
The responsive behaviour is fluid and the canvas state will also maintain the scroll point as the width of its container changes.<br/>
This behaviour is maintained even when varying between touch and no-touch devices (as allowed by chrome's dev tool), and the listener on the user's interaction will be appropriately varied at runtime.<br/>
The buttons immediately below the canvas have the functions to advance to the next slide (if any), return to the previous slide, go to the first and last slide respectively.

## How to use it?

Initialising a controller for a carousel on a canvas element is extremely simple. Simply instantiate the class with the following arguments
